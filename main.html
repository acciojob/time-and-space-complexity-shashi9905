    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
      Time complexity is a way to represent how the running time of an algorithm increases with input size. A lower time complexity usually means the algorithm is more efficient.

    <p>
      <b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of working storage an algorithm needs. For example, an algorithm that uses O(n) space requires memory that grows linearly with the input size.
